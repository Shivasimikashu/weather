# weather_prediction_using_rnn
# Overview
In this project,demonstrates a complete workflow for building, training, and evaluating an RNN-based model for weather prediction, focusing on temperature prediction in this case. It employs LSTM layers, which are well-suited for sequential data tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.
1. Python 3.x
2. TensorFlow
3. NumPy
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib
# To run the provided Python code step by step, follow these instructions:
# Install Required Libraries:
*Before running the code, ensure that you have installed the required libraries. You can install them using pip, if you haven't already:
# CMD Command:
* __pip install numpy pandas matplotlib keras plotly scikit-learn__
# Prepare Data:
*Make sure you have the dataset file "seattle-weather.csv" located at the correct path specified in the code  like ("/content/seattle-weather.csv"). If the dataset is in a different location or has a different name, adjust the file path accordingly.

# Run the Code:
*Open a Python environment (IDE, Jupyter Notebook, or any Python interpreter) and copy the provided code into a Python script or a Jupyter Notebook cell.

# Execute the Code: 
*Run the code. This will execute each line of code sequentially.
